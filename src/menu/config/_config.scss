// Used in a .form-row to prevent stretching small fields to full width when the
// menu is wider than its min-width. Stretching to full width seems to be
// Boostrap's style but I find it looks really off when a field only holds a few
// digits for example. Can't use normal grid breakpoints because the menu width
// isn't based on the window width.
//
// Negative margin prevents moving content below down by 1px when a spacer gets
// moved to its own row.
.col-spacer {
	margin-top: -1px;
}
